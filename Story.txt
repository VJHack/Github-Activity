One day in a place far, far away, there was an old lad that went to Kwik Trip to pick up some bacon. It was a fine day in the city of Madison. Everybody was out and about even though this deadly disease known as the Coronavirus was among them. This virus is said to kill any and every person that it comes into contant with. However, these Madisonites simply pretended as if this virus did not exist and went about their day. As this lad approached the door, he bright, luminous sign that read "MUST WEAR A MASK". He had never seen such a sign before and was confused at the moment. He doubted whether they would let him in because he did not have a mask on him. All this poor lad wanted was some bacon.
